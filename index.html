            <h1> Climate </h1>
            <p>Daily life in Ancient Egypt revolved around a giant river called the Nile and the fertile land it produced along its banks. The flooding of the Nile refined the soil and in return gave good annual harvests to the Egyptians. However, Ancient Egypt's climate resembles today's; a dry, hot desert climate with very minimal to no rainfall. Egypt's coastal zone was blessed with winds coming from the Mediterranean Sea, while temperatures inland were scorching, even more so during summer season.</p>

            <h1> Social Classes </h1>
            <p>What was life like in Ancient Egypt? Egypt's society was structured like a pyramid & was based on a common Egyptian ideology, called ma'at, which mainly focused on truth & balance in a society. First of all, Egyptians had a system of social classes ranging from pharaohs, to peasants. Your social class depends on what social class your parents were in. The social classes include: pharaohs, govt. officials, priests, scribes, artisans, & peasants. Pharaohs are a figure in a society much like a king/dictator hybrid. The types of government officials were the vizier, the treasurer, & the general of the armies. The vizier often acted as a supreme judge. The treasurer oversaw the governmentâ€™s wealth. The general of armies oversaw warfare. Priests worked at the temples, conducting daily rituals, & feeding the idols they worshipped. A scribe recorded daily life, the amount of crops harvested & just basic information that needed to be tracked. Artisans included sculptors, carvers, carpenters & painters. Peasants worked in fields.</p>
